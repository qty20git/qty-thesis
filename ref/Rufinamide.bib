	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a linear two-stage robust optimization model with a mixed integer recourse problem. Currently, this type of two-stage robust optimization model does not have any exact solution algorithm available. We ﬁrst present a set of suﬃcient conditions under which the existence of an optimal solution is guaranteed. Then, we present a nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm that can derive an exact solution in ﬁnite steps. The algorithm development also yields novel solution methods to solve general mixed integer bi-level programs and some fourlevel programs. Finally, the proposed framework is demonstrated through an application of a robust rostering problem with part-time staﬀ scheduling in the second stage.},

	abstract = {Robust-optimization models belong to a special class of stochastic programs, where the traditional expected cost minimization objective is replaced by one that explicitly addresses cost variability. This paper explores robust optimization in the context of two-stage planning systems. We show that, under arbitrary measures for variability, the robust optimization approach might lead to suboptimal solutions to the secondstage planning problem. As a result, the variability of the second-stage costs may be underestimated, thereby defeating the intended purpose of the model. We propose sufﬁcient conditions on the variability measure to remedy this problem. Under the proposed conditions, a robust optimization model can be efﬁciently solved using a variant of the L-shaped decomposition algorithm for traditional stochastic linear programs. We apply the proposed framework to standard stochastic-programming test problems and to an application that arises in auctioning excess electric power.},

The required heat and fluidization promotion of the fast pyrolyzer are provided by hot syngas from the gasifier. Light gas and syngas from the fast pyrolyzer are finally converted to hydrocarbons via Fischer‐Tropsch synthesis. Multiple syngas production technologies, hydrocarbon production and downstream upgrading routes are incorporated within a superstructure optimization based process synthesis framework. This is the first article to investigate the benefits associated with the introduction of conventional catalytic cracking and dewaxing from a systems engineering perspective. Surrogate models describing the gasifiers and rigorous equations for Fischer‐Tropsch effluents validated by our experimental collaborator are introduced. Through investigation of five scenarios the primary parameters affecting overall economic performance are identified through ranking of the relevant candidates.

The steady-state process model considers reactor design from regressed kinetic parameters including investigation of maximum allowable PFR reactor dimensions to maximize the benefits of API flow synthesis. Continuous LLE modeling considers solute partitioning between phases, UNIFAC-modeled liquid–liquid equilibria and mass transfer correlations for LLE design. Optimal LLE design configurations from the considered superstructure require fresh solvent added to the first vessel in co-current flow in addition to the countercurrent flow in the cascade. Optimization results indicate toluene as the best solvent choice, with total costs of 3.944 × 106 GBP for a plant capacity of 103 kg API year−1.},

To date, there is no comprehensive mitigation plan to completely handle such a volume of solvent waste generated annually by the chemicals sector. These organic solvents can account for up to 90\% of the process by mass and are often discarded after a single use. Incineration, the most widely used process for solvent disposal, is not a green method because of the release of harmful pollutants and greenhouse gases to the environment. A systematic framework for solvent recovery has been developed to overcome the drawbacks of the existing disposal methods. This framework uses a superstructure-based approach that considers the simultaneous comparison of multiple separation technologies for solvent recovery. The viability of this framework was tested using two representative case studies of varying complexities. These case studies were analyzed and formulated as mixed-integer nonlinear programming optimization problems. In both cases, solvent recovery is an economically favorable choice to conventional incineration. Herein, we demonstrate the capability of our solvent recovery framework to obtain economically viable solvent recovery pathways.},

	abstract = {Pharmaceutical safety has received increasing attention from governments and corporations, and building a safe and eﬀective pharmaceutical cold supply chain network has become an important issue. This paper proposes a two-stage pharmaceutical cold supply chain network design problem considering drug safety, in which the drug demand, transportation costs, and drug safety risk costs are assumed to be random variables. Due to the presence of uncertainty and the fact that information about the distribution of uncertain parameters is often only partially known, a distributionally robust optimization method is used to handle the uncertainty. A two-stage distributionally robust optimization model is constructed, in which the reliability of the estimation of the demand necessary to satisfy the entire cold chain network is ensured to be greater than a certain predetermined level by introducing an ambiguous joint chance constraint. The decision process for the problem can be divided into strategic and operational decisions with the goal of minimizing the total costs related to facility construction, the purchase of raw materials, drug production, transportation, and safety risks. By introducing an ambiguity set with mean and covariance information to describe the uncertain parameters, the two-stage model is eventually reformulated as a standard second-order cone program, thus making it computationally tractable. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the proposed models and optimization methods.},

	abstract = {Pharmaceutical process design and engineering increasingly recognizes the role of chemical engineering in optimizing the productivity of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) as well as their scale-up. In the present study, this concept is outlined through the kinetic model of numerous parallel and serial reactions that proceed via a two-step benzazepine heterocyclic compound synthesis, introducing 1-(2-bromoethyl)-4-chlorobenzene (4CEBr) and allylamine (AA) as ﬁrst step reactants, N-(4-chlorophene thyl)prop-2-en-1-aminium chloride (4CPAL) as intermediate (second step reactant), and (1R)-8-chloro-1methyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine (lorcaserin) as the desired product, with the second step heterogeneously/homogeneously (negligible mass transfer resistance) catalysed by AlCl3 as Lewis acid. In addition to these, a plethora of by-products, formed through various mechanisms ranging from eliminations, nucleophilic and electrophilic substitutions and additions, Friedel–Crafts reactions and others, was identiﬁed and quantiﬁed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy (HPLC–MS) and gas chromatography. A large set of experiments was executed for both the ﬁrst and second step, varying temperature (20–60 °C for the ﬁrst and 100–120 °C for the second step), reactant and catalyst concentrations, as well as the presence of the ﬁrst-step reactant (4CEBr and AA) in the second, whereas the stepwise multi-regression modelling with consequent sensitivity analysis ensued. Model optimization indicated that conversions as high as 91\% may be achieved in the second step; nonetheless, that a trade-off between yield and productivity has to be considered. An efﬁcient optimization of synthesis steps facilitates further downstream separation, as well as streamlines process intensiﬁcation when proceeding to the crystallization of API polymorph.

In this context, the contributions of this work are fourfold: (1) a comparison between flexibility analysis and robust optimization from a historical perspective is presented; (2) for linear systems, new formulations for the three classical flexibility analysis problems—flexibility test, flexibility index, and design under uncertainty—based on duality theory and the affinely adjustable robust optimization (AARO) approach are proposed; (3) the AARO approach is shown to be generally more restrictive such that it may lead to overly conservative solutions; (4) numerical examples show the improved computational performance from the proposed formulations compared to the traditional flexibility analysis models. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

The purpose of functional modeling is to represent the relationsships between the system goal and the underlying phenomena. The role of different aspects of functional modeling within the ongoing development of process systems engineering is analyzed. The fundamental principles of functional modeling for the object under investigation are presented and functional modeling hermeneutics are defined as translating the modeling goal into desired system properties, identifying the theory needed to model the system to represent these properties and identifying criteria for evaluation of system purpose and performance. Different types of functional models are developed, leading up to a discussion of their relation to quantitative computational physicochemical models. The application of functional modeling concepts is reviewed first for computer-aided molecular design then for process design, innovation, and finally for process monitoring including alarm handling. Within process modeling, it is demonstrated that functional modeling hermeneutics can be viewed as a common foundation for many different functional model types applied in diverse areas, such as monitoring, alarm handling, fault detection, and consequence reasoning, as well as for traditional simulation with computational physicochemical models. The concepts of interpretation or hermeneutics of modeling and design are suggested as being essential for chemical engineering science. The paper concludes that, with the desire for more-flexible tools within process systems engineering, it may be worthwhile to base such tools on the functional modeling paradigm as a common foundation for the different model types.},

	abstract = {The continuous crystallization behavior of an air–liquid segmented tubular crystallization process was investigated using glycine as a model compound. Process parameters such as aspect ratio of the liquid slug, Reynolds number, seed loading, tubing material, slug shape, and tube crystallizer arrangement were optimized experimentally for their effect on the growth rate, size distribution, and morphology of the produced crystals. An Eulerian liquid–solid two-phase model coupled with a realizable k−ε model in a computational fluid dynamics platform was also used to simulate the suspension state and the flow trajectory of crystals in a liquid slug. The results of our study indicated that a uniform crystal size benefiting from a heightened flow dynamics of crystals can be achieved under the following conditions: a slug aspect ratio of 1:1, 2 wt \% seed loading, a Reynolds number higher than 22.87, a tubing material with highly hydrophobic properties and a resulted highly spherical slug shape. The growth rate of crystals was the highest when the slug aspect ratio of the slug was 1:1. The horizontal arrangement of the crystallizer has a more homogeneous slug velocity and crystal velocity in slug though the crystal growth rate and crystal size were not significantly affected by different arrangements. These results give an insight into the air–liquid segmented tubular continuous crystallization process.},

Future growth within the chemical process industries is likely to involve even keener competition with greater impact from factors such as raw material and energy availability, climate change mitigation, sustainability, and inherent security. The future will probably see an expanded role for the systematic generation process synthesis paradigm, including an increased interdependency with process and catalytic chemistry on one hand and operability and control expertise on the other. Advances from artificial intelligence may inspire new process synthesis paradigms incorporating more effective representations of the underlying physical sciences and engineering art, new social concerns, new design strategies, and new computerized implementations. The future may also see a collaboration of the systematic generation and superstructure optimization process synthesis paradigms in which systematic generation is used to create the superstructure for simultaneous discrete and continuous variable optimization. As the resulting process designs will certainly be evaluated from additional points of view including social considerations, superstructure optimization will need to produce families of good designs for multi-criteria Pareto optimization.

The mathematical modeling of either of the two representations is performed with generalized disjunctive programming (GDP), and then converted systematically into mixed integer linear programs/mixed integer non-linear programs (MILP/MINLP) problems. The application of this methodology is illustrated with the synthesis of distillation sequences, with and without heat integration, which lead to MILP problems. It is shown that ad hoc models that have been reported in the literature can be systematically derived, and in the case of separation sequences with heat integration, a new improved model is derived.

The capabilities of the framework are highlighted in a case study, which addresses the challenges of how to synthesize and design wastewater treatment plant configurations under influent uncertainties. In order to handle multiple stochastic constraints, a black-box solver using a new infill criterion for surrogate-based optimization is also proposed.

This article addresses the optimal design of a large-scale processing network for producing a variety of algae-based fuels and value-added bioproducts under uncertainty. We develop by far the most comprehensive processing network with 46,704 alternative processing pathways. Based on the superstructure, a two-stage adaptive robust mixed integer fractional programming model is proposed to tackle the uncertainty and select the robust optimal processing pathway with the highest ROI. Since the proposed problem cannot be solved directly by any off-the-shelf solver, we develop an efficient tailored solution method that integrates a parametric algorithm with a column-and-constraint generation algorithm.

In this article, we propose a multi-stage adjustable robust optimization approach to alleviate the risk from such operational uncertainties during scheduling decisions. We derive a novel robust counterpart of a deterministic scheduling model, and we show how to obey the observability and non-anticipativity restrictions that are necessary for the resulting solution policy to be implementable in practice. We also develop decision-dependent uncertainty sets to model the endogenous uncertainty that is inherently present in process scheduling applications. A computational study reveals that, given a chosen level of robustness, adjusting decisions to past parameter realizations leads to significant improvements, both in terms of worst-case objective as well as objective in expectation, compared to the traditional robust scheduling approaches. © 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 62: 1646–1667, 2016},

Long term decisions involve new installations, expansions and elimination of warehouses and factories handling multiple products. It is also considered which warehouses should be used as repair work-shops in order to store, repair and deliver used units to customers. Tactical planning includes deciding inventory levels (safety stock and expected inventory) for each type of spare part in distribution centers and customer plants, as well as the connection links between the supply chain nodes. Capacity constraints are also taken into account when planning inventory levels. At the tactical level it is determined how demand of failing units is satisfied, and whether to use new or used parts. The uncertain demand is addressed by defining the optimal amount of safety stock that guarantees certain service level at a customer plant. In addition, the risk-pooling effect is taken into account when defining inventory levels in distribution centers and customer zones. Due to the nonlinear nature of the original formulation, a piece-wise linearization approach is applied to obtain a tight lower bound of the optimal solution. The formulation can be adapted to several industry-critical units and the supply chain of electric motors is provided here as an example.},

To ascertain the feasibility and viability of this continuous synthetic route, systematic process modelling and costing is required. This paper presents a technoeconomic analysis of the upstream continuous flow synthesis of rufinamide via steady-state process modelling and plantwide simulation. Reaction kinetics and Arrhenius parameters are estimated from previously published experimental data, and plug flow reactor (PFR) volumes are calculated towards rigorous plant costing. Continuous reactor and separator units have been designed, and the CPM flowsheet is compared vs. the batch production method, with respect to technical efficiency and profitability. Plantwide costing via an established economic analysis methodology has been pursued to enable a detailed comparison of cost items towards process scale-up, as well as motivate the need for further systematic optimisation.},

Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is childhood-onset epilepsy with multiple different types of seizures that impair intellectual development. To treat LGS, Novartis developed an antiepileptic drug known as rufinamide that contains a 1,2,3-triazole ring, and it is manufactured by Eisai under the brand name of Banzel or Inovelon.

Chem. Res. 2018 57, 9925–9942), we have studied five base case processes for biofuel production with fixed process structures. This work presents an integrated methodology to consider new process structures for the optimal synthesis of lignocellulosic biomass-to-liquid (BtL) fuel production processes. Given that the five base cases showed not only a significant difference of production costs among the process sections but also distinct biofuel product profiles in terms of gasoline and diesel productivity, the current methodology is developed in two parts: part 1 presents the superstructure synthesis through the step-by-step definition of unit operations’ possible interconnections to include all possible new process alternatives than base cases. The superstructure is developed based on the data collected from unit operations’ rigorous simulation of the base cases. Part 2 presents the superstructure algorithm setup and optimization for the optimal synthesis of BtL process flowsheets with specified product profiles of gasoline and diesel productivity. Rigorous simulation results for process units and process sections are used in the superstructure formulation and its algorithm development. Three case studies have shown that the integrated methodology can generate new production processes with specified product profiles while having lower total manufacturing costs than base cases.},

	abstract = {Rufinamide is an antiepileptic drug used to treat the Lennox–Gastaut syndrome. It comprises a relatively simple molecular structure. Rufinamide can be synthesized from an organohalide in three steps. Recently we have shown that microreactor flow networks have better sustainability profiles in terms of life-cycle assessment than the respective consecutive processing in a batch. The analysis was based on the results of a single step conversion from batch to continuous mode. An uninterrupted continuous process towards rufinamide was developed, starting from an alcohol precursor, which is converted to the corresponding chloride with hydrogen chloride gas. The chloride is then converted to the corresponding organoazide that yields the rufinamide precursor via cycloaddition to the greenest and cheapest dipolarophile available on the market. The current process demonstrates chemical and process-design intensification aspects encompassed by novel process windows. Single reaction steps are chemically intensified via a wide range of conditions available in a microreactor environment. Meanwhile, the connection of reaction steps and separations results in process-design intensification. With two in-line separations the process consists of five stages resulting in a total yield of 82\% and productivity of 9 g h−1 (11.5 mol h−1 L−1). The process minimizes the isolation and handling of strong alkylating or energetic intermediates, while minimizing water and organic solvent consumption.},

The steady-state process model considers reactor design from regressed kinetic parameters including investigation of maximum allowable PFR reactor dimensions to maximize the benefits of API flow synthesis. Continuous LLE modeling considers solute partitioning between phases, UNIFAC-modeled liquid–liquid equilibria and mass transfer correlations for LLE design. Optimal LLE design configurations from the considered superstructure require fresh solvent added to the first vessel in co-current flow in addition to the countercurrent flow in the cascade.

Under this approach, we are willing to accept a suboptimal solution for the nominal values of the data in order to ensure that the solution remains feasible and near optimal when the data changes. A concern with such an approach is that it might be too conservative. In this paper, we propose an approach that attempts to make this trade-off more attractive; that is, we investigate ways to decrease what we call the price of robustness. In particular, we flexibly adjust the level of conservatism of the robust solutions in terms of probabilistic bounds of constraint violations. An attractive aspect of our method is that the new robust formulation is also a linear optimization problem. Thus we naturally extend our methods to discrete optimization problems in a tractable way. We report numerical results for a portfolio optimization problem, a knapsack problem, and a problem from the Net Lib library.},

	abstract = {We describe a two-stage robust optimization approach for solving network flow and design problems with uncertain demand. In two-stage network optimization, one defers a subset of the flow decisions until after the realization of the uncertain demand. Availability of such a recourse action allows one to come up with less conservative solutions compared to single-stage optimization. However, this advantage often comes at a price: two-stage optimization is, in general, significantly harder than single-stage optimization.

For network flow and design under demand uncertainty, we give a characterization of the first-stage robust decisions with an exponential number of constraints and prove that the corresponding separation problem is 𝒩𝒫-hard even for a network flow problem on a bipartite graph. We show, however, that if the second-stage network topology is totally ordered or an arborescence, then the separation problem is tractable.

Unlike single-stage robust optimization under demand uncertainty, two-stage robust optimization allows one to control conservatism of the solutions by means of an allowed “budget for demand uncertainty.” Using a budget of uncertainty, we provide an upper bound on the probability of infeasibility of a robust solution for a random demand vector.

We generalize the approach to multicommodity network flow and design, and give applications to lot-sizing and location-transportation problems. By projecting out second-stage flow variables, we define an upper bounding problem for the two-stage min-max-min optimization problem. Finally, we present computational results comparing the proposed two-stage robust optimization approach with single-stage robust optimization as well as scenario-based two-stage stochastic optimization.},

To reduce the computational complexity, we develop a tailored and efficient decomposition method based on the framework of generalized Benders decomposition by exploiting the special structure of the integrated problem. The decomposed master problem is a scheduling problem with variable processing times and processing costs, as well as the Benders cuts. The primal problem comprises a set of separable dynamic optimization problems for the processing units. By collaboratively optimizing the process scheduling and the process dynamics, the proposed method substantially improve the overall economic performance of the batch production compared with the conventional sequential method which solves the scheduling problem and the dynamic optimization problems separately. In comparison with the simultaneous method which solves the integrated problem by a general-purpose MINLP solver directly, the proposed method can reduce computational times by orders of magnitude.},

Symmetric uncertainty sets are then introduced to confine the uncertain parameters, and budgets of uncertainty are used to adjust the degree of conservatism. We then apply both the Benders decomposition algorithm and the column‐and‐constraint generation (C\&CG) algorithm to efficiently solve the resulting two‐stage ARO problem, which cannot be tackled directly by any existing optimization solvers. Two case studies are considered to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed modeling framework and solution algorithms.

To circumvent the problem of infinite dimensionality in the constraints, an equivalence for the feasibility condition is established which leads to a max-min-max constraint. It is shown that if the inequalities are convex, only the vertices in the polyhedron need to be considered to satisfy this constraint.

A primary development was the addition of mixed-integer linear programming relaxations to BARON's portfolio of linear and nonlinear programming relaxations, aiming to improve dual bounds and offer good starting points for primal heuristics. Since such relaxations necessitate the solution of NP-hard problems, their introduction to a branch-and-bound algorithm raises many practical issues regarding their effective implementation. In addition to describing BARON's dynamic strategy for deciding under what conditions to activate integer programming relaxations in the course of branch-and-bound, the paper also describes cutting plane and probing techniques that originate from the literature of integer linear programming and have been adapted in BARON to solve nonlinear problems. Finally, we describe BARON's primal heuristics for finding good solutions of mixed-integer nonlinear programmes.

	abstract = {A large number of problems in production planning and scheduling, location, transportation, finance, and engineering design require that decisions be made in the presence of uncertainty. Uncertainty, for instance, governs the prices of fuels, the availability of electricity, and the demand for chemicals. A key difficulty in optimization under uncertainty is in dealing with an uncertainty space that is huge and frequently leads to very large-scale optimization models. Decision-making under uncertainty is often further complicated by the presence of integer decision variables to model logical and other discrete decisions in a multi-period or multi-stage setting. This paper reviews theory and methodology that have been developed to cope with the complexity of optimization problems under uncertainty. We discuss and contrast the classical recourse-based stochastic programming, robust stochastic programming, probabilistic (chance-constraint) programming, fuzzy programming, and stochastic dynamic programming. The advantages and shortcomings of these models are reviewed and illustrated through examples. Applications and the state-of-the-art in computations are also reviewed. Finally, we discuss several main areas for future development in this field. These include development of polynomial-time approximation schemes for multi-stage stochastic programs and the application of global optimization algorithms to two-stage and chance-constraint formulations.},

	abstract = {Optimal design under unknown information is a key task in process systems engineering. This study considers formulations that incorporate two types of unknown input parameters, uncertain model parameters, and variable process parameters. In the former case, a process must be designed that is feasible over the entire domain of uncertain parameters, while in the latter case, control variables can be adjusted during process operation to compensate for variable process parameters. To address this problem we extend the two-stage formulation for design under uncertainty and derive new formulations for the multiperiod and feasibility problems. Moreover, to simplify the feasibility problem in the two-stage algorithm, we also introduce a KS constraint aggregation function and derive a single, smooth nonlinear program that approximates the feasibility problem. Three case studies are presented to demonstrate the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Batch distillation is an important separation process for small-scale production especially in pharmaceutical, specialty chemical and biochemical industries. Although batch distillation units require lower capital cost than continuous units, the unsteady state nature of the process, results in higher operating costs. Optimal control in batch distillation is a mode of operation which allows us to optimize the column operating policy by selecting a trajectory for reflux ratio. Due to the uncertainties in thermodynamic models the reflux ratio profile obtained is often suboptimal. Recently a new method was proposed by Rico-Ramirez et al. [Comput. Chem. Eng. 27 (2003) 1867] to include time-dependent uncertainties in current formulations of batch distillation optimal control for ideal systems. In this paper, a general approach is proposed to handle both dynamic and static uncertainties in thermodynamics for more complex non-ideal systems. The static uncertainties result from the inaccuracies associated with predicting vapor–liquid equilibrium using group contribution methods such as UNIFAC. The unsteady state nature of batch distillation translates these static uncertainties into time-dependent uncertainties. A new Ito process representation is proposed for the dynamic behavior of relative volatility for non-ideal mixtures. Numerical case studies are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of this approach for batch as well as bio-processing.},
